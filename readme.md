# Welcome to the Official Electron Hub Extension Packs!
Over here, you can find many extension packs created by our very own Atom Services Community.
######
__Please note this is not the place where you get original Electron Hub__
The original Electron Hub may be found [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!Ak_DKkD4pwhubcVxI5lnMdzeaP4?e=WfbX0X).

### How this works:
In this repository, there is a collection of compressed files that contain the extension you want to download. 
However, currently Electron Hub doesn't support automatic detection and addition of extensions 
(and probably never will as it is meant to educate people to some degree about programming)
To find out about how to intitialize your extension(s), please visit the [official discord](https://discord.gg/RFWJZJUJFf).

### Please read all students, and teachers who want to hunt us down:
This software is created by Atom Services as a optimization program for students. The stressed lives of students can be relieved here by escaping from reality,
and then returning back to work. Not only does and will Electron Hub have games, it will also feature tools to enhance the learning and productivity of students in school.
Now, because of all of the extenstions and features of Electron Hub, we the developers of Electron Hub do acknowledge that this software is probably one to upset many school staff.
But then again, we are the fruits of your labour. You alone have made us students (now adults) so well trained in order to make sites like this. Most of the current and future
devs of this software take this on as a fun challenge (we polled the devs last year). This is a bit long so we will just bullet some stuff and be done with it.
Takeaways:

- Electron Hub is a stress reliving and student learning optimization site
- All features that are (Most regrettably) irritating to school staff are not intellectual properties of Atom Services or Electron Hub
- These extensions are created by anonymous developers and are only reviewed for compatibility
- We encourage students to wisely use Electron Hub to enhance learning and optimize their enviorment but because of the flexibility of this software, we can't do anything if they make bad choices.

    <summary>Why aren't we removing unhelpful extensions?</summary>
    It is because we want Electron Hub to be customizable to each and every person's needs. Each person has different needs in order to enhance themselves,
    and we don't want anyone to have stagnent potential.
